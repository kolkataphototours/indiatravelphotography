        <p class="padding-around">
          On Day 5 of our journey, we will board a domestic flight from Kolkata
          to Varanasi. Upon arrival at Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport
          in Varanasi, we will be transferred to our hotel by mini bus. The
          hotel is conveniently situated near Assi Ghat (approximately 1 - 1.5
          hours away from the ghats, depending on traffic). This specific hotel
          has been chosen due to its close proximity to the bustling ghats,
          ensuring easy access for us throughout our stay.
