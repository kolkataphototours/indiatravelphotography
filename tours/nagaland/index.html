                On the first day, we will gather in Dimapur after flying in from
                Kolkata. Take some time to rest and rejuvenate before joining
                your fellow travellers for a delightful dinner. During the

                valuable photography tips and insights into the upcoming days.
                If you haven't visited Kolkata yet, we encourage you to do so
                and experience our three-day Photography Tour of Kolkata before
                joining us in Dimapur. Kolkata offers convenient flights to
