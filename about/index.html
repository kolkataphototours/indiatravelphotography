            Our early childhood was spent in the holy city of Varanasi, which is
            also our birthplace. However, we eventually moved to Kolkata,
            famously known as the "City of Joy", in search of better
            opportunities. It didn't take long for us to fall in love with the
            city's vibrant culture. During our teenage years, we developed a
            keen interest in photography. Shivam pursued photography
            professionally, while Shubham enjoyed exploring the city and
            communicating, which helped both of them a great idea of vision
            behind street photography and storytelling. Eventually, we decided
            to establish our first photo tour company, kolkataphototours.com.
            Over the last five years, we have collaborated with over 150
            photographers and filmmakers through kolkataphototours.com.
            Furthermore, we have expanded our photography tour services to cover
            various destinations throughout India. We guarantee a memorable
            photo tour experience in India with us.

              <p>
                Introducing Shivam Pandey, a devoted street photographer
                currently residing in Kolkata, a lively and vibrant city in
                India. Shivam is an inquisitive and daring individual who takes
                pleasure in discovering novel locations, immersing himself in
                diverse cultures, and seizing the essence of people's existence
                through his camera. Despite being brought up in a traditional
                society that discouraged pursuing one's passion as a viable
                option for a flourishing future, Shivam chose to follow his
                instincts and pursue his ardour for photography. Although he
                didn't have any formal education in photography, he was
                fortunate to work with some of the industry's finest
                professionals, which honed his abilities and refined his
                artistic perspective. With a natural talent for narration and a
                profound affection for capturing genuine moments, Shivam's
                photography reflects his adventurous spirit and his capacity to
                connect with people from all walks of life. As a photography
                tour leader, he relishes sharing his knowledge and techniques
                with other aspiring photographers, urging them to embrace their
                creativity and pursue their dreams, just like he did.
